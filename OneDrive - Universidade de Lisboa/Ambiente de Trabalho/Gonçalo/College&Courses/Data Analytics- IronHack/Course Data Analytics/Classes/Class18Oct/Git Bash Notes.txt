-->To add a repo to the folder we want:

1) Open folder with git bash
2) git clone repo url




-->How to branch a repo, with a branch called area:

1) git checkout -b area  (it creates a new branch called area and branches to the area branch)


--Check in which branch we are:

1) git branch


-->Aftter making the changes, we have to send the changes to github repo:

1) git add .

2) git status (to see changes and where they were added)

3) git commit -m "area of the circle"

4) git push   (as there's no new branch what will have to do is this command:)

5) git push --set-upstream live


#when you go to the repo, we can see that the branches were added and we have to make a new pull request in github to send the area branch to main



-->AFTER  making changes, next day per example youshould:

1) git pull

2) git checkout area

3) git branch

4) git merge


#to know the changes made we need to write : git log 

--------------------------------

For labs:


We'll need to Fork, push, 

-After it, we go to the lab folder and on the path we delete and write cmd (comand line)   #an alternative option is to open writing git bash.ink (git bash command line)

-We then write jupyter notebook. We make the changes and do the lab and afterwards (the same for git bash too):

and after add. , commit and pull 


-After on github we'll have to go to github:

create a new pull request and on the name we have to paste the name of the repo and write our name after
